**SARAS Endoscopic Vision Challenge for Surgeon Action Detection 2020** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the medical and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 53370 images with 46325 labeled objects belonging to 21 different classes including *PullingTissue*, *CuttingTissue*, *SuckingBlood*, and other: *BladderAnastomosis*, *PullingSeminalVesicle*, *CuttingSeminalVesicle*, *BladderNeckDissection*, *CuttingProstate*, *PullingProstate*, *SuckingSmoke*, *UrethraDissection*, *PullingVasDeferens*, *PullingBladderNeck*, *CuttingMesocolon*, *ClippingTissue*, *ClippingBladderNeck*, *ClippingSeminalVesicle*, *CuttingThread*, *CuttingVasDeferens*, *ClippingVasDeferens*, and *BaggingProstate*.

Images in the SARAS-ESAD 2020 dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 23919 (45% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (6088 images), *val* (7130 images), and *train* (40152 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the Smart Autonomous Robotic Assistant Surgeon (SARAS) EU Consortium.
