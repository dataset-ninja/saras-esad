**SARAS endoscopic vision challenge for surgeon action detection 2020** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the medical and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 53370 images with 46325 labeled objects belonging to 21 different classes including *PullingTissue*, *CuttingTissue*, *SuckingBlood*, and other: *BladderAnastomosis*, *PullingSeminalVesicle*, *CuttingSeminalVesicle*, *BladderNeckDissection*, *CuttingProstate*, *PullingProstate*, *SuckingSmoke*, *UrethraDissection*, *PullingVasDeferens*, *PullingBladderNeck*, *CuttingMesocolon*, *ClippingTissue*, *ClippingBladderNeck*, *ClippingSeminalVesicle*, *CuttingThread*, *CuttingVasDeferens*, *ClippingVasDeferens*, and *BaggingProstate*.

Images in the SARAS-ESAD 2020 dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 23919 (45% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (6088 images), *val* (7130 images), and *train* (40152 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [Smart Autonomous Robotic Assistant Surgeon (SARAS) EU consortium](http://saras-project.eu/).
