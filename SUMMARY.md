**SARAS endoscopic vision challenge for surgeon action detection 2020** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 53370 images with 46325 labeled objects belonging to 21 different classes including *PullingTissue*, *CuttingTissue*, *SuckingBlood*, and other: *BladderAnastomosis*, *PullingSeminalVesicle*, *CuttingSeminalVesicle*, *BladderNeckDissection*, *CuttingProstate*, *PullingProstate*, *SuckingSmoke*, *UrethraDissection*, *PullingVasDeferens*, *PullingBladderNeck*, *CuttingMesocolon*, *ClippingTissue*, *ClippingBladderNeck*, *ClippingSeminalVesicle*, *CuttingThread*, *CuttingVasDeferens*, *ClippingVasDeferens*, and *BaggingProstate*.

Each image in the SARAS-ESAD 2020 dataset has bounding box annotations. There are 23919 (45% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (40152 images), *test* (6088 images), and *val* (7130 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [(SARAS) Smart Autonomous Robotic Assistant Surgeon EU consortium](http://saras-project.eu/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
